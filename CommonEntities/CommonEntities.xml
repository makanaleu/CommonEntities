            The position property is used to reconstruct the order of the items in

            and that the first items in this list correspond to the "top" or 
            beginning of the breadcrumb trail, e.g. with a site or section homepage.
            The specific values of 'position' are not assigned meaning for a 
            BreadcrumbList, but they should be integers, e.g. beginning with '1' 
            for the first item in the list.

            <remarks>
            Text values are best if the elements in the list are plain strings.
            Existing entities are best for a simple, unordered list of existing
            things in your data. ListItem is used with ordered lists when you 
            want to provide additional context about the element in that list 
            or when the same item might be in different places in different 
            lists.
            
            Note: The order of elements in your mark-up is not sufficient for 
            indicating the order or elements. Use ListItem with a 'position' 
            property in such cases.

            type of the property, either pointing to an external vocabulary, or
            a Web resource that describes the property (e.g. a glossary entry).
            Standards bodies should promote a standard prefix for the identifiers
            of properties from their standards.
